UDM - Unified Data Model
========================

Case Platform is based on the UDM principle - we apply a Unified Data Model to describe all data objects used to create applications, and their relations.
The Model is a tree-like object structure. Each of the objects has a set of customizable attrributes. While you create the application, you can create and name those UDM objects by your own choice.

UDM has two levels: logical and physical.
- **The logical level** contains the objects which exist only in UDM. While the Case Platform is deployed, it authomatically creates basic UDM objects as system application roles. You can also create your objects within the model. The logical objects ease data management allowing to structure them in the nost convienent way.
- **The physical level** objects are actual objects containing data, such as files, and tables with their columns, and database fields.
